# V8 RISC-V Tools

This directory is for tools developed specifically for the development of the RISC-V backend. This directory will ultimately not be upstreamed.

## analyze.py

This is a simple tool to parse debug output from the RISC-V assembler and
simulator to generate information useful for debugging.

Current features:
* Call stack

To use the tool, first execute your test with the flags `--print-all-code` and
`--trace-sim`, dumping the output to a file. Then execute this tool, passing
it that dump file and it will generate the call stack to stdout.
```bash
$ cctest --print-all-code -trace-sim test-interpreter-intrinsics/Call &> out
$ analyze.py out
```

The full usage information can be printed using `--help`:
```
usage: analyze.py [-h] [--inline] [--target TARGET] [--print-host-calls]
                  [--fp]
                  logfile

positional arguments:
  logfile

optional arguments:
  -h, --help          show this help message and exit
  --inline            Print comments inline with trace
  --target TARGET     Specify the target architecture
  --print-host-calls  Print info about calls to host functions
  --fp                Print floating point arguments and return values
```

## Dockerfile

The Dockerfile in this directory can be used to build and run a docker container which checks out and builds a given branch of v8.

To build, pass the GitHub repo and sha or branch name in as build arguments:
```
docker build --build-arg GITHUB_REPOSITORY=v8-riscv/v8 --build-arg GITHUB_SHA=riscv-porting-dev --tag v8 .
```

You can then run the testsuite for your new build:
```
docker run v8
```

## test-riscv.sh

This is a simple bash script which executes the testsuite. It is required to verify that all tests triggered by this script pass before opening a PR. This script should be kept up-to-date to run the same set of tests that the CI job runs.

## CountInstr.py

This is a simple tool to collect statistics and compare codes generated by two different backends.

usage:
```
python3 ./v8-riscv-tools/CountInstr.py path_to_riscv_d8 path_to_mips_d8  [args of d8]
```
example:
```
python3 ./v8-riscv-tools/CountInstr.py ./out/riscv64.sim/d8 ./out/mips64el.debug/d8 test.js --test --enable-slow-check
```

## collect-convertible.py 

This is a simple tool to collect statistics on instructions that can be directly rewritten into C-extension instructions.

To use the tool, first execute your test with the flags `--print-all-code` or
`--print-code`, dumping the output to a file. Then execute this tool, passing
it that dump file and it will print statistics on convertible instructions.
```bash
$ cctest --print-all-code test-interpreter-intrinsics/Call &> out.log
$ collect-convertible.py out.log
```

The full usage information can be printed using `--help`:
```
usage: collect-convertible.py [-h] [-v] logfile

positional arguments:
  logfile

optional arguments:
  -h, --help     show this help message and exit
  -v, --verbose  print all convertible instructions
```
